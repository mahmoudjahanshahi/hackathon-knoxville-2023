# Project ideas

- Research related to Scientific Software (maybe focusing in Room Acoustics for my PhD)
- Label repositories as to if they are a part of an OSS Foundation and when that affiliation began.
- Make a scientific software corpus
- Using World of Code to identify scientific software repositories to assemble a corpus with the help of AI/ML LLM technology.
- Possibly try to correlate README features to the number of GitHub stars
- Analyze the "halflife" of code for languages over time (does code written in a particular language remain more stable over time than others?)
